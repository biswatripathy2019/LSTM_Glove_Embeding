              " 'from the films first shot  keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn  thus invoking all the clichs cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strongminded rebellious female character in period drama  i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myselfjoe wright seemed not only to have not read the book  but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austens subtle  nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling  delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawingrooms  but a sort of ucertificate wuthering heights thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason  in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain not to mention that jane austen  and in particular p  p  is not about passion  sexual tension or love its about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society which was completely ignored  so that the bennets house was a rambunctious  chaotic place where everybody shouts at once  runs around  leaves their underwear on chairs  and pigs wander happily through the house  the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style danceorgy  and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for proprietythe genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety  and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots  particularly in this film  to function was completely erased subtlety in general was nowhere int his film  sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performancesit was so obviously trying to be a serious film the humour  which is pride  prejudice  both austens methodology and her appeal  was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this pofaced melodrama  and when it was allowed in  was handled so clumsily pride  prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points  yes  but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour  they are embedded in it you cant lose jane austens technique  leaving only the bare bones of the story  and expect the themes to remain not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavyhanded mysticalnuminous fauxbrow cinematographyelizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman  an adult  mature and sensible and clearsighted keira knightley played the first half of the film like an emptyheaded giggling schoolgirl  and the second half like an emptyheaded schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine elizabeths wit  her combative verbal exchanges  her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybodys follies including her own  her strength and composure  and her fantastic clearsightedness were completely lost and replaced with  what a lot of giggling and staring into the distance rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs  she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation  and not genuinely raging  either  no  these were petulant hissy fits and where the great strength of austens elizabeth  at least in austens eyes  was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety  knightleys elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore  she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strongminded  and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance in which quest for blandness and weakness  she was ably matched by matthew macfaydendonald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak  ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic his special bond with lizzie  as the only two sensible people in a world of fools  was completely lost  not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools  and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact mr bingley was no longer amiable and wellmeaning to the point of folly  but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs  and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen  delivered with remarkable clumsiness  and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedyjust get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache',\n",

committed to whatever it is and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it but were all different  made of different clay  as one of the characters in this film puts it  which is what makes life so interesting some people are just plain crazy  though and maybe thats the way you have to be to live among the masses who knows who knows what it takes to make things life work writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it  using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed and how one gets committed and obsession  in committed  starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant  committed  obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy  too her name is joline  and this is her storyadmittedly  joline has always been a committed person  in work  relationships  in life in general shes a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what and when she marries carl  luke wilson   its forever the only problem is  someone forgot to tell carl and 597 days into the marriage  hes gone  off to find himself and figure it all out when joline realizes hes not coming back  she refuses to give up on him  or their marriage maybe its because of that clay shes made of regardless  she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him  which she does in el paso  texas  of all places but once she knows where he is  she keeps her distance  giving him his space and not even letting him know shes there she considers carl as being in a spiritual coma  and its her job to keep a spiritual vigil over him until he comes to his senses and while she watches and waits  her life is anything but dull  as she encounters a young woman named carmen  patricia velazquez   a waitress at one of the local eateries  carmens grampy   alfonso arau   who is something of a mystic  tbo  mark ruffalo   a truck driver who has issues concerning carl  and neil  goran visnjic  an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her for joline  its a journey of discovery  during which she learns a lot about carl  but even more about herselftheres a touch of humor  a touch of romance  and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot and krueger presents it all extremely well  delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining her characters are very real people  with all the wants  needs and imperfections that make up the human condition  a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story we see it from jolines pointofview  as krueger makes us privy to jolines thoughts and therefore her motivations  which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold that  along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates  makes for a very effective piece of storytelling theres an underlying seriousness to this subject matter  but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavyhanded or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters and the result is a well textured  affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call lifeheather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable  adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person  and one that is real and for this film to work  it was imperative that joline be viable and believable and graham succeeds on all fronts her screen presence has never been more alluring  and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes  is enough to draw you in entirely its all a part of the character she creates  theres an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance  who she is inside and out shes a likable  agreeable person  and because youve shared her innermost thoughts  you know who she is its a good job all the way around  beginning with the way the character was written  to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to lifeas carmen  patricia velazquez is totally engaging  as well her performance is very natural and straightforward  and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character she has a charismatic presence  but is less than flamboyant  and it gives her an aspect that is attractively downtoearth she is refreshingly open and upfront  you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back  but is totally honest on all fronts  and that  too  is part of her appeal and  as with joline  this character is well written  and velazquez brings her convincingly to lifeoverall  there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film  including those of luke wilson  casey affleck  as jolines brother  jay   goran visnjic  alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as tbo  who  with very little actual screen time  manages to create a memorable characterthe supporting cast includes kim dickens  jenny   clea du vall  mimi   summer phoenix  meg   art alexakis  new york car thief   dylan baker  carls editor   and mary kay place  psychiatrist  a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture

              " 'years ago  when darling lili played on tv  it was always the pan and scan version  which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus  i decided to purchase and watch it once and for allboy  what a terrible film its so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now  its obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals  mary poppins  sound of music  thoroughly modern millie  etc  but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself  camelot  my fair lady  etc  because hollywood thought she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort  to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities  never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole  it just doesnt work at all to a point of it being very embarrassingmind you  the version on the dvd is the directors cut  or in this case  lets salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd  edwards cut 19 scenes  19          from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minutes into it and we still dont know whats going on or why were watching whats going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someones death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things arent helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around  trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings theres no catalyst in this storyone only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews  and edwards  previous successes the best  or worst  example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest edwards channeling sound of music its no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970  that scene might have worked on a certain level but today  that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment ill give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julies mary poppins persona  which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending  birds eye view of julie running towards hudsons plane  is another wink at sound of musicthe whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer  born from a german father and british mother  who lives in england but sings her  english  songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in midsentence im like what happened herethe comedy bits are unfunny and cringeworthy every scene with the french police are pathetic wheres peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train  hudsons squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train  almost killing lili in the process brilliant whats also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning thats one slow moving train there the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film  and the reason i gave this film 3 stars  but its effect is diminished considerably because its repeated at the end speaking of redundant  did we really need to see a cancan dance  crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no mans land is ok even if its bleeding obvious  but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital  making me wonder  how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spyingthe whole project is listless and without energy the romance is 100 unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking  check out the museum scene  julie looks dazed  like shes on valium but what really kills this illconceived project is julie playing a german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision as much as i like julie  shes no greta garbo  who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough  even if julie plays a german spy  she still comes across as cloying and cutehow bad is darling lili even after 37 years since its release  blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release',\n",

              " 'i was disgusted by this movie no it wasnt because of the graphic sex scenes  it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art it shows one piece of art work that she did  judith beheading holofernese  but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first judith for a year after the triali dont know if you understood this from the movie  probably not  tassi was not a noble character he raped artemisia it was not love  it was rape he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia  aka had sex with  while she states over and over again its truei encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about dont base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie i encourage you to do some research  artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art workdont see the movie  but find out the true story of artemisia',\n",
              " 'such a joyous world has been created for us in pixars a bugs life  were immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film  but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when its in the right hands that is  a bugs life is a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equallywarm feeling  and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only highcalibre film productionsit is only pixars second animated feature the subgroup of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995  with their landmark movie toy story it was a movie which defied convention  reinvented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence now  they return with their sophomore effort which  to be honest  draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the filmafter all  its a film about ants well  all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bugs life  but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film  as humans are the focal point in dramas  romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie  let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however  we forget that in toy story  a bunch of toybox items were able to become the grandest  most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat  and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounternot only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there isnt an unpleasant character in sight  even the villains are riveting characters  but theyre colourful  theyre eclectic  and theyre idiosyncratic and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term  only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bugs life from the beginning we shall start with our main character  and our hero his name is flik  david foley   and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush  beautiful ant island  he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan  as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the seasons harvest with his anticsthe problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper  kevin spacey   who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants  when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone  they go insane  for lack of a better term hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his packs hands  however  its a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cogs and clockwork in fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame  and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colonys rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppersif you think about it  a bugs life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot lines of akira kurosawas classic seven samurai  or the american remake the magnificent seven  in which a village of hapless but goodhearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone villagedweller goes in search for help in the big city  finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in a bugs life  the help comes in the form of a downandout circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a barroom brawlmuch amusement comes out of these scenes  and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs among them are an erudite stick insect  david hyde pierce   a sidesplitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasifemme fatale ladybug whos in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug  dennis hopper  its exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs onscreen  as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact onscreen  as is the entire movie collectivelyas ive said  much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another  which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines  wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie what makes a bugs life even better is that the film isnt restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be  although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichd kidfriendly situations are a bit more abundant than wed like however  its easy to ignore this fault  and its incredulously easy to enjoy this filmalthough a bugs life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor  this is still a superb movie  and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that theyre not just a onehit wonder  but instead a muchgifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly  and when someone always manages to top their standards  its only always by themselves what more is there to say about a bugs life other than  see it  its not quite the best which weve seen from the folks at emeryville  california  but this beats out the lot of its year  and ill be damned if this isnt the best animated feature of 199885 10',\n",
              " 'what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel i do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original this version is no different i felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision everanyway back to this version it aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style it succeeds in both but high art it is nit throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybethe direction was average and the editing abysmal worse than the old quincy deepak verma does a great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think that the casting is the strongest point of this project although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had its clear that he was a director for hire and didnt instill the project with the passion that it deserved',\n",

              " 'it is surprising that a production like this gets made these days  especially for television considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes  not to mention lesbianism  this has been given superb treatment and directionthe sets and costumes are flawless  the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable there is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes the protagonist is really a tragic figure  but not devoid of happiness also  this production avoids the mistake most films shows make when dealing with homosexuality lesbianism the characters are very human it seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on tv and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay not so with this in tipping the velvet  the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian means the bbc have made some wonderful productions in the past  and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts',\n",
